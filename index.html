        <h2>The Thinkpad Legacy</h2>
        <video width="968" controls autoplay src="thinkpad.mp4"></video>
        <h2 id="r">Description</h2>
        <p class="d">ThinkPad 13 is designed to balance mobility and productivity for professionals, students, and educators alike. Built to pass 12 Military Specification tests for durability, it can withstand the travails of the boardroom and the boarding ramp – yet it’s still ultralight, and features a battery that lasts a full work day.</p>
        <h2>Features</h2>
        <h3 class="r">Tough enough for the military</h3>
        <p class="d">Tested against 12 military-grade requirements and passing more than 200 quality checks, ThinkPad 13 was designed to withstand work, travel, fun, and anything else you can throw at it.</p>
        <h3 class="r">Keep your hands on the keyboard- because you'll want to</h3>
        <img src="keyboard.png" height="283" width="390">
        <p class="d">The legendary ThinkPad keyboard is so comfortable to use, you won't want to move your fingers off it – not even to use a mouse. So it's a good thing you won't have to, because this keyboard includes two pointing options – the world-famous <a href="https://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/TrackPoint-pointing-stick" target="_blank">Trackpoint</a> and our intuitive, clickable TrackPad. Move your cursor, make selections, zoom in and out, and drag and drop easily and comfortably. These features are only two of the reasons our keyboard has won awards and the hearts of users across the world!</p>
        <h3 class="r">Easy to take it with you, even without a charger</h3>
        <p class="d">At 1.44 kg / 3.17 lbs and merely 19.1 mm – 19.8 mm / 0.75" – 0.77" thin, ThinkPad 13 is eminently portable. And it has all the battery power you need – up to 11 hours – to move from desk to meetings and elsewhere, and stay productive throughout the business day with plenty of charge left afterward.</p>
        <h3 class="r">Productivity never looked so good</h3>
        <p class="d">ThinkPad 13 has a 13.3" display that renders in Full High Definition (FHD), so even spreadsheets look beautiful. And with In-plane Switching (IPS) technology, they’ll show in vibrant color and be visible from almost any angle.</p>
        <h3 class="r">Lose the ethernet cable</h3>
        <img src="u.png" height="189" width="390">
        <p class="d">With support for 802.11 AC wireless signals, there’s no need to be limited by the length of an Ethernet cable. Simply access the signal available from many wireless routers, and you’re online in no time.</p>
        <h3 class="r">Plenty of ports</h3>
        <p class="d">Connect to just about any accessory you need, whether it’s an external drive via speedy USB 3.0, a phone or other device via USB Type-C, or a TV or other monitor via HDMI. Whatever you have, plug it in and get started.</p>
        <h3 class="r">Docking with power</h3>
        <p class="d">A OneLink+ port enables you to transform ThinkPad 13 into a full-featured machine at your desk. Simply plug into the dock and you have instant access to superfast data transfers; high-quality, uncompressed video; and convenient accessories such as keyboard, mouse, printer, and up to two external displays. And the OneLink+ connector charges your battery while you’re working.</p>
